- ## [**Wasserstein GAN**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/papers/2018/0727)
    > EM与其他距离和散度的比较，WGAN可以提升稳定性，更好的收敛

- ## [**Are GANs Created Equal? A Large-Scale Study**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/papers/2018/0725)
    > fair and comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art GANs, it is necessary to report a summary of distribution of results, a series of tasks of increasing difficulty for which undisputed measures.
    >
    > We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes.

- ## [**The GAN Landscape: Losses, Architectures, Regularization, and Normalization**](https://cugtyt.github.io/blog/papers/2018/0723)
    > losses, regularization and normalization schemes, and neural architectures, and their impact on the on the quality of generated samples which we assess by recently introduced quantitative metrics.
